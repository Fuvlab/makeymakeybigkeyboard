MakeyMakey hack to manage 1 octave and an half piano with GarageBand or LMMS

You'll find subfolder per compatible DAW. For now Apple GarageBand (MacOS only) and LMMS (http://lmms.io, for Windows, Linux and MacOS). On each DAW folder there's
- an Arduino IDE sketch to customize MakeyMakey board in order to use DAW shortcuts
- a setup document (french only for now sorry)
- sometime a song file for better user experience
